# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

During this project, we were tasked with assisting an employee of the Colorado board of elections, Tom, to find a more efficient and faster way to use Python to analyze count data such as mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic, to be able to select the new congressman.
In order to achieve this goal without any problem, we were told certain key points to analyze and detail to achieve a better result. These key points are:

 1. Get the total number of votes cast.
 2. Get the complete list of candidates who received votes.
 3. Get the percentage of votes each candidate won.
 4. Get the total number of votes each candidate won.
 5. Announce the winner of election based on popular vote.
 
## Resources

The resources we use for this analysis were:

- Election_Results.csv file to analyze and compile the great amount of data presented on it.
- Software Versions: Python 3.9.12 and Visual Studio Code 1.72.2

## Election-Audit Results

After using Python along with VS Code to analyze the data of the elections we could gather the following data:

- The total amount of votes cast in this congressional election were 369,711.

- The total number of votes as well as their percentage for each county as presented below shows that the county with the largest number of votes is Denver.

 * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
 - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
 - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

- The three candidates along with their number of votes and the percentage of the total votes received as show below demonstrates that the winner of the election is 
Diana DeGette. With a total number of votes of 272.892 and a total percentage of votes of 73.8%, candidate DeGette outperformed her competitors by more than doubling their results.

 - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
 - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
 - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

Shown below we share a picture of the final results after collecting the data from the Election_Results.csv file.
